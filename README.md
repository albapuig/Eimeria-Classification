# Eimeria Classification – Final Degree Project (TFG)

This repository contains the code and notebooks developed as part of my **Final Degree Project (TFG)** in Computational Mathematics and Data Analytics. The goal of this project is to **automate the classification of *Eimeria* species** in poultry using morphological features extracted from images and analyzed via machine learning techniques.

## 📚 Project Overview

*Coccidiosis* is a parasitic disease caused by *Eimeria* species, and accurate species identification is essential for disease control. This project combines **image processing** to extract morphological features with **machine learning tools** to classify *Eimeria* species.
